# Submission of QOSF Mentorship Screening Task
## Task-4: Find the lowest eigenvalue of the given matrix
-I have tried to solve the task 4 where I applied minimize function as optimizer with method as **COBYLA** where I was able to obtain the eigenvalue ≈ *-0.9995*. 
-This is very close to the expected eigenvalue = -1.0. I have applied variational method, converted them into computational basis for measurement by applying certain gates. Calculated expectation values from parameters ranging from *-π* to *π* and then plotted them to get a better understanding of it. I also tried to simulate it with noise which gave interesting results where the eigenvalue obtained was ≈ -0.7751.
