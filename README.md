## Task-4: Find the lowest eigenvalue of the given matrix
I have tried to solve the task 4 where I applied minimize function as optimizer with method as *COBYLA* where I was able to obtain the eigenvalue ≈ -1.99276. This is very close to the expected eigenvalue = -2.0. I have applied variational method, converted them into computational basis for measurement by applying certain gates. Calculated expectation values from parameters ranging from 0 to 2π and then plotted them to get a better understanding of it.
